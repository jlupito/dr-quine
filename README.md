This project is about the recursion theorem of Kleene!

**Colleen - The source code must contain at least:**
◦ A main function.
◦ Two different comments.
◦ One of the comments must be present in the main function
◦ One of the comments must be present outside of your program.
◦ Another function in addition to the main function (which of course will be called)

**Grace - The source code must strickly contain:**
◦ No main declared.
◦ Three defines only.
◦ One comment.
• The program will run by calling a macro.

**Sully:**
• When executed the program writes in a file named Sully_X.c. The X
will be an interger given in the source. Once the file is created, the program compiles
this file and then runs the new program (which will have the name of its source file).
• Stopping the program depends on the file name: the resulting program will be ex-
ecuted only if the integer X is greater or equals than 0.
• An integer is therefore present in the source of your program and will have to evolve
by decrementing every time you create a source file from the execution of the pro-
gram.
• You have no constraints on the source code, apart from the integer that will be set
to 5 at first.
